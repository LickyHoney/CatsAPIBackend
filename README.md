## Reflection

- This weeklong assignment is to review my backend API development capabilities. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for backend development. I have used Visual studio code and tested on chrome browser on a Mac laptop. I have deployed using a free hosting service on Netlify. Final app url link https://benevolent-granita-cdc3a0.netlify.app. This app featured to display cats from Cat API. Consumed developped Cat API collection using Axios library.
